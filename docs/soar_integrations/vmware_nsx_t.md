# VMware NSX-T Integration

The VMware NSX-T integration for Chronicle SOAR allows interaction with the NSX-T Data Center platform, enabling automation of network security actions like managing firewall rules and security groups.

## Overview

VMware NSX-T Data Center is a network virtualization and security platform that provides virtualized networking, security services (like the distributed firewall and gateway firewall), load balancing, and more for multi-cloud environments and data centers.

This integration typically enables Chronicle SOAR to:

*   **Manage Security Groups:** Add or remove virtual machines (VMs) or IP addresses from NSX-T security groups. This is often used to apply or remove specific firewall policies associated with those groups.
*   **Manage Firewall Rules:** Create, update, or delete rules within the NSX-T distributed firewall (DFW) or gateway firewall policies, often to block or allow specific traffic based on IP addresses, ports, or services.
*   **Query Network Objects:** Retrieve information about existing security groups, firewall rules, IP sets, or other network objects within NSX-T.

## Key Actions

*(Since the specific Python file is unavailable, the exact actions and parameters cannot be listed. Common actions would include:*
*   *`Add/Remove VM/IP to/from Security Group`*
*   *`Create/Update/Delete Firewall Rule`*
*   *`Get Security Group Members`*
*   *`Get Firewall Rule Details`*
*   *`Add/Remove IP to/from IP Set`*
*   *`Ping (Test Connectivity)`)*

## Use Cases

*   **Automated Network Containment:** When a VM is identified as compromised, automatically add its IP address to an NSX-T security group associated with a "Quarantine" firewall policy that blocks most network traffic.
*   **Blocking Malicious IPs:** If threat intelligence identifies a malicious IP address, automatically create a firewall rule in NSX-T to block all traffic to/from that IP.
*   **Dynamic Policy Updates:** Based on alerts or vulnerability scan results, move VMs between security groups with different levels of network access control enforced by NSX-T firewall policies.
*   **Auditing:** Query NSX-T for specific firewall rules or group memberships as part of compliance checks or investigations.

## Configuration

*(Details on configuring the integration, including the NSX-T Manager URL, API credentials (username/password or certificate-based authentication), and any specific SOAR platform settings, should be added here.)*
