# ZeroFox Integration

The ZeroFox integration for Chronicle SOAR allows interaction with the ZeroFox External Threat Intelligence and Digital Risk Protection platform. This enables enriching incidents with intelligence about external threats targeting brands, domains, executives, and social media presence.

## Overview

ZeroFox provides solutions for identifying and remediating external threats across the public attack surface, including social media, domains, mobile app stores, and the dark web. They focus on issues like phishing sites, brand impersonation, executive impersonation, data leakage, and malicious social media activity.

This integration typically enables Chronicle SOAR to:

*   **Query Alerts:** Retrieve alerts generated by the ZeroFox platform related to monitored assets (domains, social accounts, etc.).
*   **Get Alert Details:** Fetch specific information about a ZeroFox alert, including the threat type, source, and affected asset.
*   **Enrich Indicators:** Query ZeroFox for intelligence related to domains, URLs, or social media handles identified during investigations.
*   **Manage Takedowns (Potentially):** Initiate or check the status of content takedown requests submitted through ZeroFox (depending on API capabilities).

## Key Actions

*(Since the specific Python file is unavailable, the exact actions and parameters cannot be listed. Common actions would include:*
*   *`List Alerts` (with filters for type, severity, asset)*
*   *`Get Alert Details`*
*   *`Get Domain/URL/Handle Intelligence`*
*   *`Initiate Takedown`*
*   *`Get Takedown Status`*
*   *`Ping (Test Connectivity)`)*

## Use Cases

*   **Brand Protection Monitoring:** Ingest ZeroFox alerts related to brand impersonation or phishing sites into SOAR for investigation and potential automated takedown requests.
*   **Executive Protection:** Monitor for alerts related to executive impersonation on social media and trigger appropriate response workflows.
*   **Phishing Investigation:** Enrich suspicious domains or URLs found in phishing emails with intelligence from ZeroFox to identify related malicious infrastructure or campaigns.
*   **Social Media Threat Response:** Investigate and respond to malicious posts or accounts identified by ZeroFox alerts.
