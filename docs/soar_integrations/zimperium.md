# Zimperium Integration

The Zimperium integration for Chronicle SOAR allows interaction with the Zimperium Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) platform. This enables enriching incidents with mobile device threat context and potentially taking response actions on managed mobile devices.

## Overview

Zimperium provides comprehensive mobile security solutions, detecting threats across devices, networks, applications, and phishing vectors for iOS, Android, and ChromeOS endpoints. It identifies risks like malicious apps, network attacks (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle), OS vulnerabilities, and phishing attempts targeting mobile users.

This integration typically enables Chronicle SOAR to:

*   **Retrieve Device Threat Information:** Get details about threats detected on specific mobile devices managed by Zimperium.
*   **Get Device Details:** Fetch information about managed mobile devices, such as OS version, risk score, user, and compliance status.
*   **Manage Threats:** Potentially update the status of threats within the Zimperium console.
*   **Take Device Actions (Potentially):** Depending on API capabilities, potentially trigger actions like forcing a device check-in or applying specific policies via MDM/UEM integration linked to Zimperium.

## Key Actions

*(Since the specific Python file is unavailable, the exact actions and parameters cannot be listed. Common actions would include:*
*   *`Get Device Threats (by device ID, user, etc.)`*
*   *`Get Device Details`*
*   *`Update Threat Status`*
*   *`List Devices` (with filters)*
*   *`Ping (Test Connectivity)`)*

## Use Cases

*   **Mobile Threat Enrichment:** Enrich alerts involving mobile devices or users with threat and risk context from Zimperium.
*   **Compromised Mobile Device Response:** If Zimperium detects a high-severity threat on a device, trigger a SOAR playbook to notify the user, alert the security team, and potentially restrict access via other integrations (e.g., Conditional Access policies, NAC).
*   **Phishing Investigation:** Correlate phishing attempts detected by Zimperium with email security alerts or user reports in SOAR.
*   **Compliance Monitoring:** Check the risk or compliance status of mobile devices associated with users involved in security incidents.

## Configuration

*(Details on configuring the integration, including the Zimperium console URL (zConsole), API credentials (API key or username/password), and any specific SOAR platform settings, should be added here.)*
