# Workday Integration

The Workday integration for Chronicle SOAR allows interaction with the Workday Human Capital Management (HCM), financial management, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform. This enables security teams to correlate security events with HR data and potentially take actions related to user accounts within Workday.

## Overview

Workday is a cloud-based platform providing applications for financial management, human resources, planning, spend management, and analytics. From a security perspective, it's the system of record for employee information, roles, and status.

This integration typically enables Chronicle SOAR to:

*   **Retrieve Employee Information:** Get details about employees based on username, employee ID, or email address, such as their job title, manager, department, location, and employment status (active, terminated).
*   **Manage Account Status (Potentially):** Depending on API capabilities and permissions, potentially disable Workday accounts or trigger specific HR workflows for departing or compromised employees.
*   **Correlate HR Data:** Use employee information from Workday to enrich security alerts and incidents, providing context about the users involved.

## Key Actions

*(Since the specific Python file is unavailable, the exact actions and parameters cannot be listed. Common actions would include:*
*   *`Get Employee Details (by ID, email, etc.)`*
*   *`Get Manager Details`*
*   *`Get Employment Status`*
*   *`Disable Workday Account (Requires careful consideration and permissions)`*
*   *`Trigger HR Workflow (e.g., Termination Process)`*
*   *`Ping (Test Connectivity)`)*

## Use Cases

*   **Insider Threat Investigation:** Enrich alerts involving internal users with their role, department, and manager details from Workday to assess risk.
*   **Compromised Account Response:** Correlate a security alert with an employee's status in Workday. If an alert involves a recently terminated employee whose access should have been revoked, escalate the investigation. Potentially disable the Workday account as part of the response (if supported and deemed appropriate).
*   **Leaver/Offboarding Automation:** Integrate SOAR playbooks with HR offboarding processes triggered in Workday to ensure timely deactivation of accounts across various systems.
*   **User Context Enrichment:** Automatically pull manager details from Workday when an alert requires user notification or manager approval.

## Configuration

*(Details on configuring the integration, including the Workday tenant URL, API credentials (often involving setting up an Integration System User (ISU) with specific security group permissions in Workday, using API Client credentials or username/password), and any specific SOAR platform settings, should be added here.)*

**Note:** Actions modifying Workday data (like disabling accounts) require significant planning, testing, and appropriate permissions due to the critical nature of HR systems. Read-only actions like fetching employee details are generally safer and more common for security enrichment.
